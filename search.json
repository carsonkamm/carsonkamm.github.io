I came to Lincoln from Portland, Oregon, but throughout my life I’ve also lived in Colorado, California, and Florida.\nI grew up playing baseball, and have aspired to find a career in baseball long-term. Being a fan of the Tampa Bay Rays, I became aware of the underlying advanced statistics in baseball that have become prevalent across all front offices in Major League Baseball.\nSince becoming informed of these statistics, I’ve develop a strong interest in them and have spent countless hours researching and learning more about how to use these statistics in player development. I took a student manager with the Nebraska Baseball program, where I’ve been able to utilize this knowledge to assist the coaching staff with reports and information on our own players, as well as opponents."

    "text": "Pete Fairbanks made his long-awaited return from the injured list on July 17, 2022. Viewed by the Tampa Bay Rays and their fans as an essential piece to the back of the bullpen, there was lots of anticipation surrounding his return. The excitement surrounding his return died down following his first two appearances, where he surrendered three earned runs on four hits, including a home run.\nAfter those two outings, however, Fairbanks began a dominant stretch that has continued into the 2023 season up to this point. Since his third appearance of 2022, Fairbanks has gone 26 consecutive innings without allowing a run with a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 37-3, and just 11 hits allowed. It’s an unbelievable stretch that finally put Fairbanks on the radar among some fans of baseball.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nstats <- read_csv(\"stats.csv\") %>% \n  rename(BattersFaced = p_total_pa)\n\nfairbanks <- stats %>% filter(last_name == \"Fairbanks\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=stats,\n    aes(x=xwoba, y=xba, size=BattersFaced),\n    color=\"grey\",\n    alpha=.3) +\n  labs(title=\"How does Pete Fairbanks stand out among qualifying pitchers?\", subtitle=\"Fairbanks paces other pitchers in relation to xwOBA and xBA.\", x=\"xwOBA\", y=\"xBA\", caption=\"Source: Baseball Savant | By Carson Kamm\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=fairbanks,\n    aes(x=xwoba, y=xba, size=BattersFaced),\n    color=\"navy\") +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n      axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n      panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=fairbanks,\n    aes(x=xwoba, y=xba, label=last_name)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFairbanks was an outlier far and away from other pitchers in 2022, but it’s important to consider his limited workload when gauging his high-level performance.

Not shown in this graphic was xISO, where Fairbanks also had the lowest predicted value among qualifying pitchers. Possessing the lowest value in five predictive categories demonstrates great performance and probable sustainability.\nIn 2022, Fairbanks utilized a fastball and slider to neutralize opposing lineups. It’s hard for pitchers with just two pitch types to maintain effectiveness without their pitches having unique qualities, and, unsurprisingly, Fairbanks had two excellent pitch types that played off one another.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nbreakstats <- read_csv(\"breakstats.csv\")\n\n  breakstats$MY <- paste(breakstats$first_name, breakstats$last_name)\n\nbreakstats %>%\n  select(MY, ff_avg_break_z, sl_avg_break_z) %>%\n  rename(Name = MY) %>% \n  rename(FastballVBreak = ff_avg_break_z) %>% \n  rename(SliderVBreak = sl_avg_break_z) %>%\n  top_n(10, wt=FastballVBreak) %>%\n  arrange(desc(FastballVBreak)) %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  cols_label(\n    FastballVBreak = \"Fastball V-Break\",\n    SliderVBreak = \"Slider V-Break\"\n  ) %>% \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How is Pete Fairbanks so effective with just two pitches?\",\n    subtitle = \"Fairbanks has a unique rising fastball that's complimented by one of the sharpest sliders in the league.\"\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %>% \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Carson Kamm  | **Source:** Baseball Savant\")\n  ) %>% \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"navy\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Name == \"Pete Fairbanks\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      How is Pete Fairbanks so effective with just two pitches?\n    \n    \n      Fairbanks has a unique rising fastball that's complimented by one of the sharpest sliders in the league.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Name\n      Fastball V-Break\n      Slider V-Break\n    \n  \n  \n    Pete Fairbanks\n-7.5\n-44.4\n    Felix Bautista\n-8.2\n-39.1\n    Tim Mayza\n-9.4\n-30.6\n    Ryan Helsley\n-9.5\n-32.2\n    James Karinchak\n-9.5\nNA\n    Matt Bush\n-10.0\nNA\n    Javy Guerra\n-10.0\n-29.4\n    Liam Hendriks\n-10.1\n-30.7\n    Dylan Cease\n-10.3\n-35.0\n    Gerrit Cole\n-10.5\n-34.2\n    Josh Sborz\n-10.5\n-35.0\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Carson Kamm  | Source: Baseball Savant\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nFairbanks had the lowest average vertical break on his four-seam fastball among qualifying pitchers in 2022. Lower vertical break creates perceptive issues for hitters, who are accustomed to a much steeper break. Combining his rising fastball with a slider that drops more than normal creates trouble for opposing lineups. On top of that, Fairbanks has been working on a low-usage splitter this season to further keep hitters off-balance.\nPete Fairbanks has been one of the most effective pitchers over the last two seasons, yet continues to be unheard of among most baseball fans. Pending health and other circumstances, his success last season should prove to not be a fluke this season, and I expect his newly-added splitter to add to his dominance late in games."

That was the largest contract the Rays had ever given out during a free agency period in franchise history.\nBut fans and insiders were confused with the confidence the Rays had in their offense, which was notably a reason for concern in the 2022 season and eventually resulted in their elimination during the Wild Card round of the 2022 postseason. They managed to only put up one run in 24 innings and two games, resulting in a sweep courtesy of the Cleveland Guardians.\nThe Rays were banking on the progression of the players they already had on their roster and the anticipated emergence of young players in their farm system like Josh Lowe, Taylor Walls and Luke Raley. There was reasonable concern with how the offense would look heading into 2023, but there weren't many concerns with the starting rotation and bullpen, both viewed as top options in the league. \n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\nteambattingurl <- \"https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2023.shtml\"\n\nteambatting <- teambattingurl %>% \n  read_html() %>% \n  html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id=\"teams_standard_batting\"]') %>% \n  html_table(header = FALSE)\n\nteamhittingbr <- teambatting[[1]]\n\nteampitchingurl <- \"https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2023-standard-pitching.shtml\"\n\nteampitching <- teampitchingurl %>% \n  read_html() %>% \n  html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id=\"teams_standard_pitching\"]') %>% \n  html_table(header = FALSE)\n\nteampitchingbr <- teampitching[[1]]\n\nteamhittingbrrenamed <- teamhittingbr %>% \n  rename(\n    Team=X1,\n    TotalPlayersUsed=X2,\n    BatterAvgAge=X3,\n    RunsPerGame=X4,\n    Games=X5,\n    PA=X6,\n    AB=X7,\n    R=X8,\n    H=X9,\n    Doubles=X10,\n    Triples=X11,\n    HR=X12,\n    RBI=X13,\n    SB=X14,\n    CS=X15,\n    BB=X16,\n    SO=X17,\n    BA=X18,\n    OBP=X19,\n    SLG=X20,\n    OPS=X21,\n    OPSPlus=X22,\n    TB=X23,\n    GDP=X24,\n    HBP=X25,\n    SH=X26,\n    SF=X27,\n    IBB=X28,\n    LOB=X29\n  )\n\nteamhittingbaseballreference <- teamhittingbrrenamed %>% \n  filter(Team != \"Tm\" & Team != \"League Average\" & TotalPlayersUsed != \"963\")\n\nteampitchingbrrenamed <- teampitchingbr %>% \n  rename(\n    Team=X1,\n    TotalPitchersUsed=X2,\n    PitcherAvgAge=X3,\n    RunsAllowedPerGame=X4,\n    Wins=X5,\n    L=X6,\n    WinLossPct=X7,\n    ERA=X8,\n    G=X9,\n    GS=X10,\n    GF=X11,\n    CG=X12,\n    tSho=X13,\n    cSho=X14,\n    SV=X15,\n    IP=X16,\n    HPit=X17,\n    RPit=X18,\n    ER=X19,\n    HRPit=X20,\n    BBPit=X21,\n    IBBPit=X22,\n    SOPit=X23,\n    HBPPit=X24,\n    BK=X25,\n    WP=X26,\n    BF=X27,\n    ERAPlus=X28,\n    FIP=X29,\n    WHIP=X30,\n    HPerNine=X31,\n    HRPerNine=X32,\n    WalksPerNine=X33,\n    SOPerNine=X34,\n    SOPerWalk=X35,\n    LOBPit=X36\n  )\n\nteampitchingbaseballreference <- teampitchingbrrenamed\n\nteampitchingbref <- teampitchingbaseballreference %>% \n  filter(Team != \"Tm\" & Team != \"League Average\" & TotalPitchersUsed != \"518\")\n\nmerged <- teamhittingbaseballreference %>% \n  inner_join(teampitchingbref) %>%\n  mutate_at(2:62, as.numeric) %>% \n  filter(TotalPlayersUsed != \"1018\")\n\nrays <- merged %>% \n  filter(Team == \"Tampa Bay Rays\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = merged,\n    aes(x=OPSPlus, y=ERAPlus, size=Wins),\n    alpha = .1) +\n  labs(title = \"How has the Rays offense and pitching compared to other teams?\", subtitle = \"The Rays have dominated in both hitting and pitching this season, leading the league in both.\", x=\"OPS+\", y=\"ERA+\", caption = \"Source: Baseball Reference | By Carson Kamm\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data = rays,\n    aes(x=OPSPlus, y=ERAPlus, size=Wins),\n    color=\"navy\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n      axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n      panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=140, y=137, label=\"Tampa Bay Rays\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rays' offense has been a juggernaut to start the 2023 season, and their pitching staff has been as good as advertised.

Wander Franco has also been huge for the lineup, boasting a 154 wRC+ through April. I mentioned Josh Lowe, Taylor Walls, and Luke Raley, as well as the hopes that they'd progress into serviceable big-league hitters, and they've fulfilled those hopes up to this point, providing the Rays with a 188 wRC+, 173 wRC+, and a 148 wRC+, respectively (all via Fangraphs).\n\n\nCode\nhr <- merged %>% top_n(5, wt=HR)\nruns <- merged %>% top_n(5, wt=R)\nera <- merged %>% top_n(5, wt=-ERA)\nfip <- merged %>% top_n(5, wt=-FIP)\n\nbar1 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=hr, aes(x=reorder(Team, HR), weight=HR), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=rays, aes(x=reorder(Team, HR), weight=HR), fill=\"navy\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"April 2023 MLB Team Leaderboards\", subtitle = \"Teams that lead in HR, Runs, ERA and FIP.\", x=\"HR\", y=\"\", caption = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\nbar2 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=runs, aes(x=reorder(Team, R), weight=R), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=rays, aes(x=reorder(Team, R), weight=R), fill=\"navy\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title=\"\", subtitle=\"\", x=\"Runs\", y=\"\", caption = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\nbar3 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=era, aes(x=reorder(Team, ERA), weight=ERA), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=rays, aes(x=reorder(Team, ERA), weight=ERA), fill=\"navy\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x=\"ERA\", y=\"\", caption = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\nbar4 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=fip, aes(x=reorder(Team, FIP), weight=FIP), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=rays, aes(x=reorder(Team, FIP), weight=FIP), fill=\"navy\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x=\"FIP\", y=\"\", caption = \"Source: Baseball Reference | By Carson Kamm\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\nplot_grid(bar1, bar2, bar3, bar4)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rays have paced the rest of Major League Baseball in home runs and runs overall, and their pitching staff leads the MLB in ERA. Their FIP, which gauges the effectiveness of a pitcher/pitching staff in getting outs that aren't impacted by defense (strikeouts, ability to avoid walks, HBPs, HRs), is slightly higher than their ERA, which is a sign of regression. However, their team FIP still ranks third in the league. The Tampa Bay Rays have been a very fun team to watch to kick off the 2023 campaign, and it'll be interesting to see how long they can maintain their current pace, which would put them among the greatest regular season teams of all time."
