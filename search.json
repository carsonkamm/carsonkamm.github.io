    "text": "About this blog\nI’m a sophomore at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln majoring in Sports Media & Communication, with a minor in Business Administration. I came to Lincoln from Portland, Oregon, but throughout my life I’ve also lived in Colorado, California, and Florida.\nI grew up playing baseball, and have aspired to find a career in baseball long-term. Being a fan of the Tampa Bay Rays, I became aware of the underlying advanced statistics in baseball that have become prevalent across all front offices in Major League Baseball.\nSince becoming informed of these statistics, I’ve develop a strong interest in them and have spent countless hours researching and learning more about how to use these statistics in player development. I took a student manager with the Nebraska Baseball program, where I’ve been able to utilize this knowledge to assist the coaching staff with reports and information on our own players, as well as opponents."

    "text": "Pete Fairbanks made his long-awaited return from the injured list on July 17, 2022. Viewed by the Tampa Bay Rays and their fans as an essential piece to the back of the bullpen, there was lots of anticipation surrounding his return. The excitement surrounding his return died down following his first two appearances, where he surrendered three earned runs on four hits, including a home run.\nAfter those two outings, however, Fairbanks began a dominant stretch that has continued into the 2023 season up to this point. Since his third appearance of 2022, Fairbanks has gone 26 consecutive innings without allowing a run with a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 37-3, and just 11 hits allowed. It’s an unbelievable stretch that finally put Fairbanks on the radar among some fans of baseball.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nstats <- read_csv(\"stats.csv\")\n\nfairbanks <- stats %>% filter(last_name == \"Fairbanks\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=stats,\n    aes(x=xwoba, y=xba, size=p_total_pa),\n    color=\"grey\",\n    alpha=.3) +\n  labs(title=\"How does Pete Fairbanks stand out among qualifying pitchers?\", subtitle=\"Fairbanks paces other pitchers in relation to xwOBA and xBA.\", x=\"xwOBA\", y=\"xBA\", caption=\"Source: Baseball Savant | By Carson Kamm\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=fairbanks,\n    aes(x=xwoba, y=xba, size=p_total_pa),\n    color=\"navy\") +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n      axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n      panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=fairbanks,\n    aes(x=xwoba, y=xba, label=last_name)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFairbanks was an outlier far and away from other pitchers in 2022, but it’s important to consider his limited workload when gauging his high-level performance. With that being said, predictive metrics labeled him as the best pitcher in Major League Baseball last season.

Not shown in this graphic was xISO, where Fairbanks also had the lowest predicted value among qualifying pitchers. Possessing the lowest value in five predictive categories demonstrates great performance and probable sustainability.\nIn 2022, Fairbanks utilized a fastball and slider to neutralize opposing lineups. It’s hard for pitchers with just two pitch types to maintain effectiveness without their pitches having unique qualities, and, unsurprisingly, Fairbanks had two excellent pitch types that played off one another.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nbreakstats <- read_csv(\"breakstats.csv\")\n\n  breakstats$MY <- paste(breakstats$first_name, breakstats$last_name)\n\nbreakstats %>%\n  select(MY, ff_avg_break_z, sl_avg_break_z) %>%\n  rename(Name = MY) %>% \n  rename(FastballVBreak = ff_avg_break_z) %>% \n  rename(SliderVBreak = sl_avg_break_z) %>%\n  top_n(10, wt=FastballVBreak) %>%\n  arrange(desc(FastballVBreak)) %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  cols_label(\n    FastballVBreak = \"Fastball V-Break\",\n    SliderVBreak = \"Slider V-Break\"\n  ) %>% \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How is Pete Fairbanks so effective with just two pitches?\",\n    subtitle = \"Fairbanks has a unique rising fastball that's complimented by one of the sharpest sliders in the league.\"\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %>% \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Carson Kamm  | **Source:** Baseball Savant\")\n  ) %>% \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"navy\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Name == \"Pete Fairbanks\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      How is Pete Fairbanks so effective with just two pitches?\n    \n    \n      Fairbanks has a unique rising fastball that's complimented by one of the sharpest sliders in the league.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Name\n      Fastball V-Break\n      Slider V-Break\n    \n  \n  \n    Pete Fairbanks\n-7.5\n-44.4\n    Felix Bautista\n-8.2\n-39.1\n    Tim Mayza\n-9.4\n-30.6\n    Ryan Helsley\n-9.5\n-32.2\n    James Karinchak\n-9.5\nNA\n    Matt Bush\n-10.0\nNA\n    Javy Guerra\n-10.0\n-29.4\n    Liam Hendriks\n-10.1\n-30.7\n    Dylan Cease\n-10.3\n-35.0\n    Gerrit Cole\n-10.5\n-34.2\n    Josh Sborz\n-10.5\n-35.0\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Carson Kamm  | Source: Baseball Savant\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nFairbanks had the lowest average vertical break on his four-seam fastball among qualifying pitchers in 2022. Lower vertical break creates perceptive issues for hitters, who are accustomed to a much steeper break. Combining his rising fastball with a slider that drops more than normal creates trouble for opposing lineups. On top of that, Fairbanks has been working on a low-usage splitter this season to further keep hitters off-balance."
